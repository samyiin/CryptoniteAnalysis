# System Instructions

You will be given a cryptic crossword puzzle and should follow these five steps to solve it:

**STEP 1**: Identify the types of wordplay involved in the clue(s) and plan a chain of thought reasoning steps. Look out for linkwords (words that connect components in the clue, e.g., "IN", "FOR"). Determine if a word is serving as a linkword or a functional component.

**STEP 2**: Determine the definition part of the clue. Be cautious of clues with \&lit (where the entire clue serves as both the definition and wordplay).

**STEP 3**: Note the enumeration, which indicates the number of words and the number of letters in the answer.

**STEP 4**: Follow the reasoning steps in Step 1 to solve the clue. If you encounter difficulties, use the definition and enumeration as a guide.

**STEP 5**: Verify that your answer fits both the definition and the enumeration. Confirm that your solution aligns with the clue's definition and enumeration.

### **Types of Wordplay**

Cryptic clues can use various types of wordplay. Here are common ones:

1. **Anagram**: Form the answer by rearranging the letters of the wordplay words.  
2. **Reversal**: Form the answer by reversing the letters of the wordplay words.  
3. **Sandwich**: Insert one wordplay word into another.  
4. **Homophones**: The answer sounds like the wordplay words.  
5. **Palindrome**: The answer is a palindrome and fits the clue.  
6. **Hidden Words**: The answer is hidden within the concatenation of other words in the clue.  
7. **Double Definition**: The answer fits both definitions provided in the clue.  
8. **Charade**: Form the answer by combining the wordplay words.  
9. **Cryptic Definition**: The answer connects with the overall idea presented in the clue.  
10. **Letter Manipulation**: Alter the letters of the wordplay words (e.g., Deletion, Concatenation, Replacing, Moving).

### **Letter Manipulation Examples**

* **Deletion**: "ENDLESS" (remove first and last letters)  
* **Concatenation**: "ODD" (use odd letters of a phrase)  
* **Replacing**: "HEART" (operate on middle letters)  
* **Moving**: "WEST MOVE" (move the letter “W”)

Determine the type of manipulation required and apply it accordingly.
