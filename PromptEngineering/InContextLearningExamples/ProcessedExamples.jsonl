The phrase \u201cNONE SEEN FOR AGES\u201d suggests that this puzzle is a Letter Manipulation - Replacing Letter type puzzle. That means we will first find the wordplay word, and the letter to switch, then we will switch the letter in the wordplay word to get the answer. In particular, the phrase \u201cX SEEN FOR X\u201d suggests that after we found the wordplay word, and the letter to switch, we are replacing the letter to switch in the wordplay word. \nSo there are two types of puzzles in this clue: Anagram and Letter Manipulation. So our plan is to first find the anagram fodder (the wordplay word), and then find the letter to switch, and then perform anagram to get the answer. \n**STEP 2**:\nWe will then find the definition. Since the definition is almost always either at the beginning or end of the clue sentence or phrase, we will assume \u201cFAREWELL\u201d is the definition.\n**STEP 3**: \nWe will look at the word length of the answer. The enumeration suggests that the answer will be one word that is 6 letters and 3 letters connected by \u201c-\u201d. \n**STEP 4**: \nWe will solve the puzzle by following the plan we made in STEP 1: \nFirst of all, since there are two types of puzzles in the clue, we might want to start with a bit of imagination. Let\u2019s think from another direction: If we think about it:\n1. The answer is synonym of  \u201cFAREWELL\u201d \n2. The answer is one word that is 6 letters and 3 letters connected by \u201c-\u201d.\nWe can think of the phrase \u201cTOODLE-PIP\u201d, which is a British humorous term for \u201cFAREWELL\u201d.\nNow let\u2019s look from the original direction (by following the plan we made in STEP 1): \nSince it\u2019s an Anagram type puzzle, we will try to find the anagram fodder. We know that \u201cFAREWELL\u201d is the definition and \u201cHORRID\u201d is the indicator for Anagram, then we probably should find the anagram fodder in the rest of the sentence. The clue tells us to *horrid* \u201cLEPIDOPTERA\u201d. So we assume that \u201cLEPIDOPTERA\u201d is the word we want to anagram. \nSince \u201cLEPIDOPTERA\u201d is the word we want to anagram, and \u201cX SEEN FOR X\" is the indicator for Letter Manipulation, then we probably should look at the rest of the sentence. The clue tells us \u201cNONE\u201d is *seen for (instead of)* \u201cAGES\u201d, so we can see that \n1. \u201cNONE\u201d usually cues \u201cO\u201d in cryptic crosswords.  \n2. We don\u2019t see \u201cAGES\u201d in \u201cLEPIDOPTERA\u201d, but we see \u201cERA\u201d in \u201cLEPIDOPTERA\u201d. So it makes sense now: \u201cAGES\u201d cues \u201cERA\u201d. \nThen we can conclude that we are replacing \u201cERA\u201d to \u201cO\u201d in \u201cLEPIDOPTERA\u201d, so we have letters \u201cL E P I D O P T O\u201d.\nWe know that the definition is \u201cFAREWELL\u201d, so if we take a scan of the letters, we see that the letters can form the word \u201cTOODLE-PIP\u201d, which fits the definition \u201cFAREWELL\u201d. \n**STEP 5**:  \nWe will check if the answer we found is correct. FIRST, it fits the enumeration, because \u201cTOODLE-PIP\u201d is indeed one word that is 6 letters and 3 letters connected by \u201c-\u201d.  SECOND, The word \u201cTOODLE-PIP\u201d is a meaningful word and fits the definition \u201cFAREWELL\u201d. \nSo the answer is **TOODLE-PIP**"}

The word \u201cFAULTED\u201d suggests that this puzzle is an Anagram type puzzle. That means we need to shuffle the letters of the wordplay words to form the answer. The wordplay words to shuffle (the anagram fodder) can be word or phrase directly from the clue, or it could be indirect and cued by some words or phrase in the clue. \nWe can guess that the clue tells us *first in* \u201cWIMBLEDON\u201d. The phrase \u201cFIRST IN\u201d suggests that this puzzle is a Letter Manipulation - Concatenation puzzle. That means the wordplay word contains a letter from the initial letter of a word in the clue. \u201cIN\u201d here is probably a link word. \nSo there are two types of puzzles in this clue: Anagram and Letter Manipulation. So our plan is to first find the anagram fodder (the wordplay word), and then find the initial letter, and then since it\u2019s an anagram type puzzle, we are shuffling letters, so we probably should add the initial letters to the wordplay letters to get all the letters to shuffle, and then perform anagram to get the answer. \n**STEP 2**:\nWe will then find the definition.

The clue tells us *first in* \u201cWIMBLEDON\u201d, so we probably should take the initial letter \u201cW\u201d of \u201cWIMBLEDON\u201d. \nThen we can conclude that we are adding \u201cW\u201d to \u201cDOUBLE\u201d, so we have letters \u201cW D O U B L E\u201d.\nIt's still not quite clear what the answer can be.

Let\u2019s think from another direction: If we think about it:\n1. The answer is synonym of  \u201cCHECK\u201d \n2. The answer is one word with 4 letters\n3. The answer sounds like \u201cRAIN\u201d\nWe may think of the word \u201cREIN\u201d. \nAnd indeed,\u201cREIN\u201d, sounds like \u201cRAIN\u201d, and \u201cREIN\u201d fits under the definition \u201cCHECK\u201d. \n**STEP 5**:  \nWe will check if the answer we found is correct.

We know that \u201cWHAT COULD GIVE ACTORS NO END OF CACHET?\u201d is the definition and \u201cCOULD GIVE\u201d is the indicator for Anagram, then we probably should find the anagram fodder in the rest of the sentence. The clue tells us *could give (by)* \u201cACTORS\u201d. So we assume that \u201cACTORS\u201d is the word we want to anagram. \nSince \u201cACTORS\u201d is the word we want to anagram, and \u201cNO END OF\" is the indicator for Letter Manipulation - Deletion, then we probably should look at the rest of the sentence. The clue tells us *end of* \u201cCACHET\u201d, so we probably should take the final letter \u201cT\u201d of \u201cCACHET\u201d. \nThen we can conclude that we are removing \u201cT\u201d from \u201cACTORS\u201d, so we have letters \u201cA C O R S\u201d.\nIt's still not quite clear what the answer can be. Let\u2019s think from another direction: If we think about it:\n1. The answer is the answer to  \u201cWHAT COULD GIVE ACTORS NO END OF CACHET?\u201d\n2. The answer is one word that is 5 letters long. \n3. We have letters \u201cA C O R S\u201d to perform anagram.\nwe would think about the word \u201cOSCAR\u201d. which fits the definition \u201cWHAT COULD GIVE ACTORS NO END OF CACHET?\u201d. \n**STEP 5**:  \nWe will check if the answer we found is correct. FIRST, it fits the enumeration, because \u201cOSCAR\u201d is indeed one word that is 5 letters and 2 letters connected by \u201c-\u201d.  SECOND, The word \u201cOSCAR\u201d is a meaningful word and fits the definition \u201cWHAT COULD GIVE ACTORS NO END OF CACHET?\u201d. \nSo the answer is **OSCAR**"}

The word \u201cRETURNING\u201d suggests that this puzzle is a Reversal type puzzle. That means we will first find the wordplay word to reverse, and then we will reverse the letter of it to get the answer. \nWe will start by identifying the type of the puzzle. We can guess that the clue tells us the answer is *found in* \u201cRETURNING PERHAPS TO ORIGINS\u201d. The phrase \u201cFOUND IN\u201d suggests that this puzzle is a Hidden Word type puzzle. That means the answer we need to find hides inside the concatenation of the words. We just need to concatenate words in the clue, and find the answer that hides inside of them.\nSo there are two types of puzzles in this clue: Reversal and Hidden Word. So our plan is to find the wordsplay phrase, reverse the letters in the wordplay phrase, and then find the answer that is hiding inside. \n**STEP 2**:\nWe will then find the definition. Although the definition is almost always either at the beginning or end of the clue sentence or phrase, we see that the clue is a clear description of something.

The enumeration suggests that the answer will be one word that is 5 letters long. \n**STEP 4**: \nWe will solve the puzzle by following the plan we made in STEP 1: since \u201cTHEY\u2019RE FOUND IN RETURNING PERHAPS TO ORIGINS\u201d is the definition, and \u201cRETURNING\u201d is the indicator, then we probably should look at the rest of the sentence. \nFrom one direction, we see that the clue tells us *returning* \u201cPERHAPS TO ORIGINS\u201d: so we will concatenate it and reverse it to get \u201cSNIGIROOTSPAHREP\u201d. \nThen since \u201cSNIGIROOTSPAHREP\u201d is the wordplay phrase and the clue tells us the answer is *found in* \u201cRETURNING PERHAPS TO ORIGINS\u201d. The phrase \u201cFOUND IN\u201d is the indicator that it\u2019s a Hidden type, we will scan the concatenate string with a \u2018sliding window\u2019 of 5 letters. (\u201cSNIGI\u201d, \u201cNIGIR\u201d, \u201cIGIRO\u201d, \u2026\u2026)\nIt's still not quite clear what the answer can be. Let\u2019s think from another direction: If we think about it:\n1. The answer is something that \u201cTHEY\u2019RE FOUND IN RETURNING PERHAPS TO ORIGINS\u201d\n2.

Likely to hide at the connection place of words.\nWe see that \u201cROOTS\u201d in \u201cSNIGI*ROOTS*PAHREP\u201d stands out. And indeed, \u201cROOTS\u201d fits into the definition \u201cTHEY\u2019RE FOUND IN RETURNING PERHAPS TO ORIGINS\u201d. \n**STEP 5**:  \nWe will check if the answer we found is correct. FIRST, it fits the enumeration, because \u201cROOTS\u201d is indeed one word that is 5 letters long.

The word \u201cSHAKING\u201d suggests that this puzzle is an Anagram type puzzle. That means we need to shuffle the letters of the wordplay words to form the answer. The wordplay words to shuffle (the anagram fodder) can be word or phrase directly from the clue, or it could be indirect and cued by some words or phrase in the clue.\nWe can guess that the clue tells us \u201cTHE STUFF\u201d *(is) collected by* \u201cSHAKING DUSTER\u201d. The word \u201cCOLLECTED BY\u201d suggests that this puzzle is a Sandwich type puzzle. \u201cBY\u201d is probably a linkword. That means we need to find two sets of wordplay words, and we will split one wordplay word and stuff the other wordplay word inside of it to form the answer. In this case, the wordplay word of \u201cTHE STUFF\u201d is probably *inside* the wordplay word we get from \u201cSHAKING DUSTER\u201d\nSo there are two types of puzzles in this clue: Anagram and Sandwich. So we can first solve the anagram part: *shaking* \u201cDUSTER\u201d, and then we find the wordplay word for \u201cTHE STUFF\u201d, and finally we stuff \u201cTHE STUFF\u201d inside \u201cSHAKING DUSTER\u201d. However, it is almost equivalent to first find both wordplay words, and get their letters, and then perform anagram on the letters.
